====================================================================================================

Design Pattern - a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
In simple words it's a way to resolve problems in code in well known template way.
In other words - best practices for solutions to common problems designed with good OOP in mind, common answers to common problems

Creational patterns are focused on objects creation
Structural patterns are focused on objects composition and interfaces
Behavioral patterns are focused on the communications between objects


Other patterns (in the context of Spring framework):
Inversion of Control (IoC) Pattern. It improves testability, decreases coupling, enforces coding to an interface
Since Spring4.0 Proxy pattern is used in every object managed by Spring
IoC container is a factory pattern
Singleton, prototype patterns are also used in Spring
Template pattern is widely used in remote calls (JDBC, REST related)
Entire web framework is based on MVC (not classic pattern but very important)
